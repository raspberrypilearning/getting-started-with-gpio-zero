# Getting Started With GPIO Zero

![](cover.png)

The bank of pins along one side of the Raspberry Pi are called General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins.

These pins allow the Raspberry Pi to control things in the real world. You can connect components to these pins: output devices like LEDs (light emitting diodes) which can be turned on and off at will; or input devices like a button or sensor which can be used to trigger events, such as turning on an LED when a button is pressed.

With the GPIO Zero library, you can easily control the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.
