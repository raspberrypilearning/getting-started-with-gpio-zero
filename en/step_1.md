## What you will make
The bank of pins along one side of the Raspberry Pi are called General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins. 

These pins allow the Raspberry Pi to control things in the real world. You can connect components to these pins: output devices like LEDs (light emitting diodes) which can be turned on and off at will; or input devices like a button or sensor which can be used to trigger events, such as turning on an LED when a button is pressed.

With the GPIO Zero library, you can easily control the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.

## What you will learn
By completing this resource you will learn:

- How to connect up LEDs and buttons to the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi
- How to control the output of the GPIO pins using GPIO Zero
- How to read the input from the GPIO pins using GPIO Zero
